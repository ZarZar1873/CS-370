Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  For this project I acted as an AI developer working for a gaming company that was developing a treasure hunting game where the player and the AI would both navigate through a maze like area and try and find the treasure. I was given a lot of the code in terms of the game itself and the basic layers for the model. I developed a deep Q-learning algorithm that trained the pirate to navigate the environment efficiently to try to find the treasure in as few steps as possivble.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  Computer scientists develope hardware and software that futher the technological field. This advancement matters because it is how we continue to grow as a civilization. Without these advancements problems like feeding everyone and getting drinking water all the way to entertaining the masses becomes impossible.
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  I think about the problem, break the problem down into its individual steps, and try to solve each step. Iterating through can turn the biggest of problems into an easy to manage list of steps.
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  My responsibilities are to ensure that all data taken from the user is transparent both in what it is and how it is used, and my responsibilty to the organization is to ensure that the data is secured, properly handled, and that the software developed remains protected.
